CS242 Final Project Proposal

Functionality
	Create a Python-to-JS “compiler,” similar to CoffeeScript.
	If time permits, implement server-side integration that would output Node.js code.

Languages
	Python, JavaScript

Libraries
	Python standard library
	Jison compiler

Platforms
	Cross-platform

Why you chose this
	To understand compilers

Who will use this
	Anyone who wants to speed up development of client-side JavaScript or has legacy
	Python code running on their server and wants to port it over to Node.js.

Features
	Compile any python file to javascript:
		Built-in constants
		Built-in exceptions
		Built-in types
		Built-in functions
		Lex python code.
		Use grammar rules to do bottom-up parsing to output JavaScript

Testing
	We will write sample Python code and will run sample inputs on that code. 
	Then use our compiler to translate the Python code to Javascript.
	Then run the Javascript code with the same inputs and make sure the outputs match.

LEXING:
	Types of Tokens:
		Spacing
			NEWLINE
			INDENT
			DEDENT
		Identifiers
		Keywords
		Literals
		Operators
		Delimiters

How to link INDENT/DEDENT decisions from runner.js to the actual decider for rule keywords?
	-So far can have parser see variables set by runner
	RESOLVED

Now that INDENT/DEDENT works:
	-Need to generalize so I don't use magic switch statement value for INDENT/DEDENT's yystate
	-Need to figure out why whitespace is being reached always after reaching indent

Unclear as to what $$ should be in grammar rules like:
	funcdef: 'def' NAME parameters ':' suite

Manual EBNF to BNF trnslation is a pain. Maybe we should use another library that does the EBNF to BNF translation for us.
	-pyparsing library?
